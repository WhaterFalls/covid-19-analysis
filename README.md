Contains data, scripts, and Tableau workbook that I used for my analysis.

get_data.py gets the data from the Johns Hopkins University repo and cleans it up a little for my analysis: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/README.md

The data gets saved in the data folder.

The Tableau workbook is a packaged workbook so should be able to open with Tableau Reader, which is free: https://www.tableau.com/products/reader. Any further anaylsis will require a Tableau Desktop license.
